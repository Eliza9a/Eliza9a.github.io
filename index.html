      <h3>Eliza Diana Airinei</h3>
      <p>I learned C++ and a bit of HTML and CSS during high school. I participated in competitions such as Cyberfair, InfoEducatie, and Infomatrix, where I won a few prizes. In my free time, I made a game in Unreal Engine 4.</p>

      <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Game</h3>
      <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at City (2021). This Processing project comprises the use of conditionals, loops, arrays, and randomness. I created a game where the player collects snacks until the time is over. For this game, I used an image as a background, but I drew the eyes and made them move towards the mouse position. The details (for example: color, size, position, speed, and shape) of the snacks are stored in arrays and their values are random so the game has different levels of difficulty. When the time is over, a message will appear on the screen showing the score.</p>

      <h3>Project Milestone: AdventureLand</h3>
      <p>For the Project Milestone, I decided to create a 2D platform game. This includes 5 levels with different levels of difficulty. You need to control the character by pressing the arrow keys (to move left or right or to jump) and also by pressing the "space" key to jump higher when needed. To shoot, press “shift”. To reach the next level, the player must collect all the coins and destroy the obstacles (where applicable) without hitting them wrong. The character can lose life if it touches any obstacle or enemy, but if it happens, you can collect an energy drink which will increase your life points. Do not fall into the lava, otherwise, the game will be over! Doing this project was a great opportunity to learn Java and object-oriented programming.</p>

      <h3>Second Year Project: AirVia Ltd</h3>
      <p>For my second-year project, I was asked to take part in a team project. The purpose of the project was to build a new Ticket Sales System for an airline, 'AirVia Ltd'. This project was a great opportunity to work with databases and to further develop my skills in Java. Not only this, but working in a team was a valuable experience, which involved frequent communication and collaboration to provide a good product.</p>

      <h3>Final Year Project: RouteGuide</h3>
      <p>For my final year project, I developed RouteGuide, a navigation application that uses AI to tailor route suggestions according to user preferences. This project improved my proficiency in Java and deepened my experience with Firebase and APIs. The application aims to simplify travel planning. Users can choose the time availability, type of attractions, transportation preferences, budget, cultural interests, food preferences, accessibility needs, family-friendly options, shopping interests, and others. Considering the project’s complexity, I adopted the Agile methodology, specifically the iterative development process. The project was systematically divided into four primary phases: analysis, design, implementation, and testing. Each phase was further decomposed into small steps to guarantee completeness at every stage of development. This breakdown allowed for frequent reassessments and refinements, contributing significantly to the overall quality of the final product. Prior to the programming phase, I created use case specifications and diagrams to clearly display the app's features. Visual Paradigm was used to develop the necessary diagrams. The application development was done in Android Studio. For this project, the programming language used for building and managing the app’s functionality was Java.</p>
