      <p>I learned C++ and a bit of HTML and CSS during highschool. I participated with websites in competitons such as  Cyberfair, InfoEducatie, Infomatrix where I won a few prizes. In my free time I made a game in Unreal Engine 4.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Game</h3>
    <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City(2021).
       This Processing project comprises the use of conditionals, loops, arrays and randomness.
       I created a game where the player collects the snacks until the time is over. 
       For this game I used an image as a background, but I drew the eyes and made them move towards 
       the mouse position. The details( for example: colour, size, position, speed and shape) of the 
       snacks are stored in arrays and their values are random so the game has different levels of 
       difficulty. When the time is over, a message will appear on the screen saying the score.

    <h3>Project Milestone: AdventureLand</h3>
    <p>For the Project Milestone I decided to create a 2D platform game. This includes 5 levels,
     with different levels of difficulty. You need to control the character by pressing the arrow keys (to 
     move left or right or to jump) and also by pressing the "space" key to jump higher when needed.
     To shoot press “shift”. To reach the next level, the player must collect all the coins and destroy the
     obstacles (where is the case) without hitting wrong. You must be careful because the character can lose
     life if it touches any obstacle or enemy, but if it happens, you can collect an energy drink which will
     increase your life points. Do not fall into the lava, otherwise the game will be over! Doing this project
     was a great opprotunity to learn java and object-oriented programming.
